# Advent of Code 2023 ðŸŽ„

Python solutions to AOC '23.

[AOC 2022](https://github.com/eaglesearcher/advent-of-code-2022) - my first year + learning python

# Running solutions

Each `day{#}.py` is self-contained.
Run `python day#.py`

# Cloning

`file_io.py` creates new days and automates data pulling.

`file_io.new_day(#)` -> spawns a new day#.py file by copying the dayX.py template and updating the day#.

`file_io.read_input(#)` -> grabs input files from `./input/`. If the file is not found, automatically attempts to pull and create the file `file_io.pull_data()`

For automated pulling, update `AOC_YEAR` at the top of `file_io.py` for the current year.  You also need to add a file named `cookie.txt` in the input directory, and copy/paste your cookie session info into it for AOC authentication.

# Secret Sauce

`algo_util.py` collects commonly reused algorithm components, but since it is in development throughout the course of the event, the latest is not guarenteed to work with earlier daily solutions (but I try).

# Examples

See `scratch.py` for file_io tests and basic daily solution timing.

# Compatibility

Primary development in core python with sprinkles of numpy.

AOC '23 environment: python 3.11.5; numpy 1.24.3
